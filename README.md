# Starter apps for Elm

There are two starter apps, both based on `Browser.element`

- Basic (vanilla)
- Basic-elements (uses elm-ui)

Each app presents a text label, text field, and a button.
What you enter in the text field is echoed in the label.
When you press the button, the text in the label is reverse.
Nothing more.
